# Mousetrap Car Project

A hands-on engineering project focused on mechanical design, motion, and energy transfer using a standard mousetrap as the power source.

## Overview

The project includes:
- SolidWorks 3D CAD model
- Experimental performance testing
- Engineering calculations (speed, power, efficiency)
- Final analysis and documentation

## Files Included
- `mousetrap_car_drawing.pdf`: Engineering drawing of the assembly
- `Eng_Car_calculations.xlsx`: Data sheet with speed, force, energy, and friction calculations
- `SolidWorks Screenshot`: CAD rendering of the car

## Key Takeaways
- Learned about torque, potential energy, and mechanical advantage
- Used CAD to model a physical system
- Collected and analyzed data from real-world testing

## Status
Project completed as part of a course module. Open to future improvements and redesigns.
