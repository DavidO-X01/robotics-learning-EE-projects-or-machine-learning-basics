# Line Follower Robot

A beginner robotics project that uses an Arduino, IR sensors, and basic control logic to follow a line on the floor.

## Components Used:
- Arduino Uno
- IR sensor module
- L298N Motor Driver
- 2 DC Motors
- 9V Battery

## Goals:
- Understand sensor feedback loops
- Learn how to use PWM for motor speed control
- Practice embedded C programming with Arduino

## Status:
Project in progress â€“ currently testing sensor alignment and motor response.
